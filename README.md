## How to use
### On Desktop
*Make sure you have Python installed.*

Open **Command Prompt** and run the following commands <br>
`pip install pillow` <br>
`pip install pypng` <br>
after that everytime you open i suggest to run this command <br>
`cd /d (directory of the translation files)` <br>
once it is set to the directory of the files run this command <br>
`python (\Directory of translation files\SCRIPT_INJECTOR.py)` <br>
after that wait for it to be finished.
